## Week 3 Project

This week's project introduces two key concepts:
1. __Encoding & Decoding__: The _encrypt_ and _decrypt_ user stories use the same function! One of the core concepts in web development and programming in general is transforming data from one format, to another, and back again.  You've been doing this without knowing it!  In last week's project you probably solved at least one of the challenges by converting your string to an array, solving the problem as an array, them converting back to a string.
1. __Problem Decomposition__: This is the skill of breaking larger problems into smaller one, solving the smaller problems, and recombining the small solutions into a complete solution.  With the _scramble_ user story, we've helped you along by already breaking down the problem into smaller pieces that can be recombined to solve the larger one.  Now it's up to you to solve them and recombine them!

| __a user can ...__ | _User Interface_ | _Handlers_ | _Core Logic_ |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| _... visit the page_ | (already done for you) | nothing! | nothing! |
| _know what this page is for_ | Structure the page (header, footer, sections, ...) <br> provide some explanation of what everything will do  | (nothing!) | (nothing!) |
| _... encrypt a string_ | nothing | write the middle section  | pass all tests for the ```caesarize``` function |
| _... decrypt a string_ | nothing | write the middle section  | nothing, you already wrote ```caesarize```! |
| _... scramble a string_ | nothing | nothing | pass all tests for ```chunk```, ```sort-words``` and ```reverse-chunk```. <br> then use those functions to pass the ```scramble``` tests |
| _... have a pleasant user experience_ | write a stylish styling sheet <br> make sure everything is responsive  | nothing | nothing |
