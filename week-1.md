# Week 1

you'll be learning the first workings of JavaScript as a language in isolation (the homeworks), experimenting with it in context (the project), and getting serious about GitHub issues & pull requests (assignment submission & feedback).

## Agenda

In class we'll go over the first tastes of JS, but the main point of class will be making sure you know how to complete and submit your homework assignments.  We'll start each assignment together to get you started for the week

### Using GitHub
* create github accounts (if you haven't) - USE YOUR REAL NAME
* what is github, what's it for?
* [pull requesting](https://github.com/janke-learning/pull-requesting) - practicing this with groups of 3 others.  This is the work flow will use to check your homework.

### homework setup
* go over the [class-5 wiki](https://github.com/HackYourFutureBEHomework/class-5/wiki/module-2---JS-1) and how turning in homework will work
* fork the [project](https://github.com/be-hacking-hyf/javascript-1-cross-module) & [homework](https://github.com/be-hacking-hyf/javascript-1-homework) repos and go over how they will be used
* practice turning in homework by forking [this repo](https://github.com/be-hacking-hyf/first-github-homework) and completing the instructions



### JS
* [what is it, what's it for](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/First_steps/What_is_JavaScript)
* stepping through & predicting execution: 
    * [python tutor](http://www.pythontutor.com/javascript.html#)
    * [js notional machine](https://github.com/janke-learning/js-notional-machine)
* [chrome inspector](https://javascript.info/debugging-chrome#tracing-the-execution)
* using [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String)
* [parsons problems](https://janke-learning.org/parsonizer/)
* language pieces: 
    * [JS fundamentals](https://github.com/HackYourFuture-CPH/JavaScript/tree/master/fundamentals)
    * [group quiz in class](https://github.com/HackYourFuture-CPH/JavaScript/blob/master/fundamentals/exercises.md)
* kick-off homework 
    * [FCC basic JS](https://github.com/be-hacking-hyf/javascript-1-homework/blob/master/week-1/fcc-basic-js-pt-1.md)
    * [errors](https://github.com/be-hacking-hyf/javascript-1-homework/blob/master/week-1/jl-errors-formatting.md)
    * [variables](https://github.com/be-hacking-hyf/javascript-1-homework/blob/master/week-1/jl-variables-swaps.md) 
    * [functions](https://github.com/be-hacking-hyf/javascript-1-homework/blob/master/week-1/jl-functions.md)

### projects launch off
* discuss [user stories](http://www.agilemodeling.com/artifacts/userStory.htm) & incremental development
* set your project forks live on GitHub Pages
* [using JS in HTML](https://javascript.info/hello-world)
* [using the chrome inspector](https://javascript.info/debugging-chrome)
* complete together the ```index.html``` for [this week's project](https://github.com/be-hacking-hyf/javascript-1-cross-module/tree/master/week-1)

## Homework

> SLACK!  Many of you have been asking us very good questions over slack, and many of you are asking the same questions!  This week ask all of your questions in your class's channel and tag us.  If you don't we won't know to answer

### Homework Priority

* :seedling: : must finish
* :dash: : must start
* :fire: : challenge

### JS

Do not only write quick solutions to the exercises to pass them. **We want you to understand more than we want you to pass a lot of exercises**.
If you don't finish everything but have understood what you finished, that's just ok.  Just be sure to let us know in your homework PR!

Really understanding the code means you could do the same work that pythontutor does but drawing yourself on a paper. To help you get there, there are all the great tools listed in the main README for this module. 

* [JS 1, week 1 homework](https://github.com/be-hacking-hyf/javascript-1-homework/week-1) - follow the link to see assignment priorities


### Project
* :seedling: [cross-module project, week 1](https://github.com/be-hacking-hyf/javascript-1-cross-module/week-1)


### Git & GitHub
* :seedling: send a pull-request to [class-5 repo](https://github.com/HackYourFutureBEHomework/class-5/tree/master/bios) containing a short bio.
* :dash: [learn git branching: remote -> clone intro 1, 2, 3, 4](https://learngitbranching.js.org/)

Most simply: if it takes one step in python tutor, it's a statement.  If it has an operator, it's an expression.  A line of code can be both a statement and an expression
