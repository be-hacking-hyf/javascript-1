## Agenda

### Review
* Your feedback on Homework & Week 1-2

### JS
* Arrays and objects: defining, accessing, and passing them as arguments to functions, using
    * [javascript.info:object](https://javascript.info/object)
    * [javascript.info:array](https://javascript.info/array)
    * [functions 4](https://github.com/colevandersWands/function-exercises/)
    * [this solution to an exercise from week 2](http://www.pythontutor.com/javascript.html#code=let%20obj_1%3D%7B%7D%3B%0Alet%20obj_2%3D%7B%7D%3B%0Aconsole.assert%28obj_1%20!%3D%3D%20obj_2%29%3B%0A//%20The%20assert%20below%20passes%20but%20why%3F%0Aconsole.assert%28obj_1.x%20%3D%3D%3D%20obj_2.x%29%3B%0A%0Alet%20key%20%3D%20%22y%22%3B%0A//%20The%20assert%20below%20passes%20but%20why%3F%0Aconsole.assert%28obj_1%5Bkey%5D%20%3D%3D%3D%20obj_2%5Bkey%5D%29%3B%0A%0Aobj_1%5Bkey%5D%3B%0Aobj_2%5Bkey%5D%3B%0A//%20The%20assert%20below%20passes%20but%20why%3F%0Aconsole.assert%28obj_1%5Bobj_2.y%5D%20%3D%3D%3D%20obj_2%5Bobj_1.y%5D%29%3B%0A%0Alet%20obj_3%20%3D%20%5Bkey%5D%3B%0Aobj_1%20%3D%20obj_2%3B%20%0Aconsole.assert%28obj_1%20%3D%3D%3D%20obj_2%29%3B%0Aconsole.assert%28obj_3%20!%3D%3D%20obj_1%29%3B%0Aconsole.assert%28obj_3%20!%3D%3D%20obj_2%29%3B%0Aconsole.assert%28obj_3%5Bkey%5D%20%3D%3D%3D%20obj_1.y%29%3B%0A%0Aobj_3.x%20%3D%20obj_2%5Bkey%5D%3B%0Aconsole.assert%28obj_3.x%20%3D%3D%3D%20obj_2%5Bkey%5D%29%3B&mode=edit&origin=opt-frontend.js&py=js&rawInputLstJSON=%5B%5D)
* Operators and implicit coercion:
    * [truthiness](https://github.com/janke-learning/truthiness)
    * [arithmetic-coercion](https://janke-learning.org/arithmetic-coercion/)
    * [equalities-coercion](https://janke-learning.org/equalities-coercion/)
    * [`==` & `===` tables](https://dorey.github.io/JavaScript-Equality-Table/)
    * [`==` game](https://eqeq.js.org/)
* Loops (`for`, `while`): [javascript.info:while-for](https://javascript.info/while-for)
* Test cases: [test cases](https://github.com/colevandersWands/test-cases/)

### Git & GitHub
* More on Pull Requesting and Merging: [QnA repos](https://github.com/colevandersWands/pull-requesting/) - in teams of 3, 3 times.  each of you once as repo owner

### Wrapping-up module 1 and onto module 2
* Why are we learning JavaScript again?
    * Sneak preview of how it's complementary to HTML & CSS, [handler functions](https://github.com/colevandersWands/three-layer-handlers)

## Learning objectives
### JS
* Understanding of Arrays and Objects: how to define and manipulate them
* Understanding of Operators and implicit coercion
* Understanding of `for` and `while` loops
* Understanding of where JavaScipt fits into Web Development, in link with Module 1 on HTML & CSS
* Understanding of the idea and usefulness of test cases, the difference between behavior and implementation

### Git & GitHub
* At ease with fork, Pull Request and Merge workflow on GitHub
