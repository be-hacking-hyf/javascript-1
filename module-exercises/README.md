In this folder you'll find a lot of files and two folders:
* __[how-to-do-exercises](./how-to-do-exercises)__: Check out this folder for a guide to completing these exercises.  Completing these exercises isn't as easy as following FreeCodeCamp or CodeAcademy, but you will learn a whole lot more!  You will have an immersive experience working in the Developer Tools. And will be able to study any snippet or function you want instead of being limited to the exercises provided.  Taking a look at how ```evaluate``` works before diving into the exercises will make the transition a bit smoother.
* __[a lot of files](./)__: This folder contains the exercises your are expected to complete by the end of the module. There are a lot of them, but have no fear!  Many are not so difficult and each file has a few similar examples to study before asking you to program yourself.  The exercises' main objective is to introduce you to important JS concepts not for you to master everything, so don't be too concerned if you feel totally comfortable with each file.  It takes years to become comfortable with JS!  And anyway, your completed exercises can act as a live study reference for later. You can always come back to review :)
* __[challenges](./challenges)__: Just what it sounds like.  Some challenge exercises for after you complete the main exercises. Not required, but definitely worth some studying.


There is a suggested order to the exercises, which is the order they are included into the index.html file.  But you are not required to study them in this order.  

You'll know you've completed the exercises when all of the links in your browser are either black or green

Have at it!
